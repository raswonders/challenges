// Given an array of positive numbers, write a function that returns the
// greatest product of any three numbers. The approach of using three
// nested loops would clock in at O(N3
// ), which is very slow. Use sorting to
// implement the function in a way that it computes at O(N log N) speed.
// (Some other implementations are even faster, but weâ€™re focusing on using
// sorting as a technique to make code faster.)
